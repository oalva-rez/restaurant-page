# WEBD 127 Creating User Centered Content - Final Project || Mystic Mocha Cafe Website
<p>The idea behind this project was to imitate a client proposal of a website they wanted to create. The website must conform to responsive design principals, and must be ADA and Mobile compliant. All project components have been fully tested against a test script of acceptance criteria. I was required to write an SOW (Statement of Work) which touched on requirements of SEO practices, tools to test for ADA and mobile compliance, threshold of usability, UAT(User Acceptance Testing), future release backlog to build out further functionality and web hosting services.</p>
<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
<p>This project allowed me to apply the ideas I learned throughout the semester which were mainly focused around accessibility, usability, acceptance criteria, and user testing. In addition, I further developed my CSS/HTML skills along with asset management practices for better performance using npm and webpack. One main takeaway from this project was writing the acceptance criteria for functionality using the "Given/When/Then" approach. I used the NVDA screen reader app to run accessibility tests of my own.</p>
